# Description of files.

## Grouped multiple testing
Simulations based on synthetic data, i.e., p-values $P_i$, covariates $X_i$ and hypothesis indicators $H_i$ under the global null, resp. the data-generating model described in Section 5.1. 

* **grouped_simulations_null.R**: Run null simulations to generate results file that is then used to generate Figure 2  (in Section 2).
* **grouped_simulations_null_section5.R**: Run null simulations to generate results file that is then used to generate Figure 3A (in Section 5.1).
* **grouped_simulations.R**:  Run simulations to generate results file that is then used to generate Figure 3B,C (in Section 5.1). 


## Multiple testing with continuous covariates

* **betamix_simulations.R**: Run simulations from Section 5.2 and generate results file that is then used to generate Figure 4. 
* **betamix_onesided_simulations.R**: Run simulations from second part of Section 5.2 and generate results file that is then used to generate Figure 5. 

## Simultaneous two-sample t-tests

* **cars_ttest_simulations.R**:  Run simulations from Section 5.3 and generate results file that is then used to generate Figure 6.
